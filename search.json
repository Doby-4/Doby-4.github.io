The graph shows the increase in the ageing population in Japan, Sweden and the USA. It indicates that the percentage of elderly people in all three countries is expected to increase to almost 25% of the respective populations by the year 2040. In 1940 the proportion of people aged 65 or more stood at only 5% in Japan, approximately 7% in Sweden and 9% in the US. However, while the figures for the Western countries grew to about 15% in around 1990, the figure for Japan dipped to only 2.5% for much of this period, before rising to almost 5% again at the present time. In spite of some fluctuation in the expected percentages, the proportion of older people will probably continue to increase in the next two decades in the three countries. A more dramatic rise is predicted between 2030 and 2040 in Japan, by which time it is thought that the proportion of elderly people will be similar in the three countries. 曲线图练习1The graph below shows the consumption of fish and some different kinds of meat in a European country between 1979 and 2004. In 1979, about 220 grams of beef , the most popular meat among others and fish, would be consumed by each resident every week. The comsuptions of chicken and lamb stood at around 150 grams per person per week. While the comsuption of fish stood at only 60, which was already the highest figure from 1979 to 2004. 作答:The graph illustrates the shifting consumption preference preferences in fish and three kinds of meat among residents in a particular European country over the period from 1979 to 2004. In 1979 the weight each resident consumed per week weekly per capita comsuption stood at only 60 grams of fish, approximately 140 grams of chicken, 150 grams of lamb and 220 grams of beef. However, while the comsuption of three kinds of meat experienced a dramatic fluctuation respectively, the comsuption of fish declined steadily to about 40 grams per person per week. The figure of beef consumption had reached its top of 230 grams in 1983, after which time it dropped to 100 in 2004 and was exceeded surpassed by chicken consumption starting from 1989 by chicken in 1989. Due to the strong growth of chicken comsumption, the same trend had presented on lamb comsuption, which correspondingly dropped to 60 grams per person per week during the period. In summary, the data illustrate a significant shift towards higher chicken consumption, while the other meats and fish declined over 25-year period. ChatGPT 你的版本已经很不错了，逻辑清晰，表达也比较准确。下面是一些具体的建议： “shifting comsumption preference”可以改为“shifting consumption preferences”来保持一致性，因为后文提到了多种食物。 “comsumption”应为“consumption”。 “weight each resident consumed per week”可以简化为“weekly per capita consumption”。 在描述数据时，如果是具体数字，要加上单位，如“230 grams”。 “after which time”这个短语有些冗长，可以简化为“after which”或者“subsequently”。 “was exceeded by chicken in 1989”建议改为“was surpassed by chicken consumption starting from 1989”以提高清晰度。 “the same trend had presented on lamb comsuption”可以改为“a similar trend was observed in lamb consumption”，使句子更加通顺。 “corespondingly”应为“correspondingly”，但在这里建议可以省略这个词。 可以在最后添加一句总结，如“In summary, the data illustrates a significant shift towards higher chicken consumption, while the other meats and fish declined over the 25-year period.” 当然，以下是一个雅思写作第一部分的范文，这部分通常要求描述一个图表： The line graph provides information about the weekly consumption of various types of meat, including chicken, beef, and lamb, as well as fish, in a European country from 1979 to 2004. &#x3D;&#x3D;It is immediately apparent&#x3D;&#x3D; that chicken consumption experienced a notable increase over the 25-year period. In 1979, the amount of chicken eaten was approximately 150 grams per person per week. This figure saw a steady rise, reaching a peak of almost 250 grams by 2004. Beef consumption, &#x3D;&#x3D;on the other hand&#x3D;&#x3D;, &#x3D;&#x3D;displayed a fluctuating pattern&#x3D;&#x3D;. &#x3D;&#x3D;Starting at&#x3D;&#x3D; around 220 grams in 1979, &#x3D;&#x3D;it&#x3D;&#x3D; dropped to just &#x3D;&#x3D;over&#x3D;&#x3D; 100 grams &#x3D;&#x3D;in the mid-1980s&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x3D;&#x3D;before rising to a high of&#x3D;&#x3D; nearly 250 grams in the &#x3D;&#x3D;early 1990s&#x3D;&#x3D;. However, &#x3D;&#x3D;this was followed by a dramatic decline&#x3D;&#x3D;, &#x3D;&#x3D;with&#x3D;&#x3D; the consumption &#x3D;&#x3D;settling at&#x3D;&#x3D; about 100 grams per person by the end of the period. The &#x3D;&#x3D;intake&#x3D;&#x3D; of lamb &#x3D;&#x3D;showed a gradual decline&#x3D;&#x3D; over the years. In 1979, lamb consumption stood at just &#x3D;&#x3D;under&#x3D;&#x3D; 150 grams per person, &#x3D;&#x3D;which had halved by 2004&#x3D;&#x3D;. Fish consumption remained &#x3D;&#x3D;relatively&#x3D;&#x3D; stable and low &#x3D;&#x3D;throughout the period&#x3D;&#x3D;, &#x3D;&#x3D;with minor fluctuations around 50 grams per person&#x3D;&#x3D;. In summary, while the consumption of chicken &#x3D;&#x3D;showed an upward trend&#x3D;&#x3D;, the consumption of beef and lamb &#x3D;&#x3D;revealed overall declines&#x3D;&#x3D;. Fish consumption remained consistently low from 1979 to 2004. 这篇范文描述了图表中的主要趋势，并用到了多样的句型和词汇。这样的写作能够达到雅思写作部分的7分标准。 模仿写作, 持续上涨: It is immediate apparent that chicken consumption experienced a notable increase over the 25-year period. In 1979, the amount of chicken eaten was approximately 150 grams per person per week. This figure saw a steady rise, surpassing chicken consumption in the late 1980s and reaching a peak of almost 250 grams by 2004. It is immediate apparent that chicken consumption experienced a notable increase over the 25-year period. In 1979, the amount of chicken eaten was approximately 150 grams per person per week. This figure saw a steady rise, surpassing beef consumption in the late 1980s and reaching a peak of almost 250 grams by 2004. 模仿写作, 波动: Beef consumption, on the other hand, displayed a fluctuating pattern. Starting at around 220 grams in 1979, it dropped to just over 170 grams in the early 1980s before rising to a high of nearly 240 grams in the mid-1980s. However, this was followed by a dramatic decline, with the consumption settling at about 100 grams by the end of the period. Beef consumption, on the other hand, displayed a fluctuating pattern. Starting at around 100 grams in 1979, it rose to just over 200 grams in the mid-1980s before dropping to a low of nearly 80 grams in early 1990s. However, this was followed by a dramatic increase, with the consumption settling at about 300 grams per person by the end of the period. 曲线图练习2The graph below shows the number of tourists visiting a particular Caribbean island between 2010 and 2017. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features,and make comparisons where relevant. 作答:The line graph illustrates the shifting amount &#x3D;&#x3D;number&#x3D;&#x3D; of tourists’ arrival &#x3D;&#x3D;tourist arrivals&#x3D;&#x3D; of a particular Caribbean island over the period from 2010 to 2017. It is immediately apparent that the total amount &#x3D;&#x3D;number&#x3D;&#x3D; of visitors experienced a notable increase over the 7-year period. In 2010, the amount number of visitors was just 1 million. This figure saw a steady rise, stably remaining at approximately 2.7 millions &#x3D;&#x3D;million&#x3D;&#x3D; from 2015 to 2016 and reaching a high of 3.5 millions &#x3D;&#x3D;million&#x3D;&#x3D; by 2017. There were mainly two means of choices to spend the holiday two choices for spending the holiday, staying on cruise ships as well as staying on island. The amount number of those who staying on cruise ships stood at around 0.25 millions million while that those staying on island was about 0.75 millions million in 2010. The figure of “cruise ships team” &#x3D;&#x3D;The number of visitors choosing cruise ships&#x3D;&#x3D; displayed a fluctuating pattern at first. It climed to 0.5 millions million in 2011 before dropping to a low of just under 0.25 millions million in 2012. However, it was followed by a steadily &#x3D;&#x3D;steady&#x3D;&#x3D; increase, surpassing the figure of “island team” those staying on island in the middle 2015 and settleing at 2 millions million by the end of the period. The amount of “island team” &#x3D;&#x3D;The number of visitor opting island&#x3D;&#x3D; showed a gradual increase over the years, with minor fluctuation around 1.5 millions after a rise during 2011 and 2013 from 0.75 millions million to 1.5 millions million. In summary, the total number of tourists showed an upward trend but the choice between cruise ships and island revealed overall chageable. In summary, while the total number of tourists visiting the island increased, preferences between staying on cruise ships and on the island fluctuated over the years. Your essay has a good structure and you have attempted to cover the main features of the graph. Here are some points for improvement and correction: “Amount of tourists’ arrival” should be “number of tourist arrivals” because we are talking about countable figures. “Total amount of visitors” should be “total number of visitors.” Use “million” instead of “millions” when you are talking about the number as a measurement. For example, it should be “approximately 2.7 million” and “reaching a high of 3.5 million.” In English, we say “there were mainly two choices for spending the holiday” instead of “means of choices to spend the holiday.” The phrase “those who staying on cruise ships” should be “those staying on cruise ships,” and similarly, “that staying on island” should be “those staying on the island.” Instead of “The figure of ‘cruise ships team’,” you might say “The number of visitors choosing cruise ships.” When you write “It climbed to 0.5 millions,” it should be “It climbed to 0.5 million.” “Steadily increase” should be “a steady increase.” “Settling at 2 millions” should be “settling at 2 million.” Instead of “The amount of ‘island team’,” it would be more appropriate to say “The number of visitors opting for the island accommodation.” The final sentence is a little unclear. Instead, you could write “In summary, while the total number of tourists visiting the island increased, preferences between staying on cruise ships and on the island fluctuated over the years.” The line graph displays the &#x3D;&#x3D;trends in&#x3D;&#x3D; tourism on a particular Caribbean island from 2010 to 2017, &#x3D;&#x3D;highlighting the figures&#x3D;&#x3D; for those staying on cruise ships &#x3D;&#x3D;versus&#x3D;&#x3D; on the island. &#x3D;&#x3D;Initially&#x3D;&#x3D;, in 2010, the island &#x3D;&#x3D;drew&#x3D;&#x3D; roughly 1 million visitors, &#x3D;&#x3D;with cruise ship tourists accounting for a quarter of that number&#x3D;&#x3D;. Over the years, the visitors on cruise ships experienced a steady increase, &#x3D;&#x3D;culminating at&#x3D;&#x3D; just above 1 million by 2017. Those staying on the island &#x3D;&#x3D;began with higher figures but showed a slower growth&#x3D;&#x3D;, &#x3D;&#x3D;peaking at&#x3D;&#x3D; about 1.5 million after a &#x3D;&#x3D;plateau&#x3D;&#x3D; from 2014 to 2016. The &#x3D;&#x3D;overall&#x3D;&#x3D; number of tourists rose &#x3D;&#x3D;markedly&#x3D;&#x3D;, from 1 million to an &#x3D;&#x3D;apex&#x3D;&#x3D; of 3.5 million by 2017. The most &#x3D;&#x3D;pronounced&#x3D;&#x3D; growth was in the cruise ship sector, &#x3D;&#x3D;suggesting a shift in tourist accommodation preference&#x3D;&#x3D; on this Caribbean island. In conclusion, tourism to the island showed a &#x3D;&#x3D;significant upsurge&#x3D;&#x3D;, especially among cruise ship passengers, &#x3D;&#x3D;contributing to a 200% increase&#x3D;&#x3D; of the total visitor numbers by the end of the period. 曲线图练习3The graph below gives information about the percentage of the population in four Asian countries living in cities from 1970 to 2020, with predictions for 2030 and 2040. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. 作答：The line graph illustrates the shifting proportion of the population living in cities among four Asian courtries over the period from 1970 to 2020 and the pridicting predicted data from 2030 to 2040 as well. Starting at just 30%, the percentage of Malaysia’s citilization urbanization grew steadily to over 72% from 1970 to 2020 and will culminate at about 82% by 2040. It is apparently obvious that the trend of Indonesia was similar to Malaysia, which experienced a notable increase. It started at 12% in 1970, climed to 50% in 2020 and is predicted to end at about 60% in 2040. The figure of Phillippines and Thailand both showed a weaker increase pattern than others. In 1970, Phillippines stood at over 31% and rose to a high of 50% from 1980 to 1990. However, it was followed by a decline, with the percentage settling about 48% in 2020. Starting at 12% in 1970, Thailand’s citilization urbanization remained a showed steady growth and was surpassed by Indonesia in 2000, predicted to culminate at 45% by 2040. All four Asian countries have displayed a&#x3D;&#x3D;n&#x3D;&#x3D; increase pattern and will continue to grow in the future. However, the speed of growth are various varies from country to country. 你的作文整体来说非常不错，基本上涵盖了雅思写作Task 1 所需要的主要元素，如数据比较和总结趋势。以下是对你作文的一些评价和建议： “shifting proportion” 和 “population living in cities” 的用法是正确的，能够准确描述图表的内容。 “pridicting data” 应改为 “predicted data”。 “citilization” 这个词可能是想表达 “urbanization”（城市化）。 “It is apparently obvious” 有点重复，可以只用 “It is apparent” 或 “It is obvious”。 在描述菲律宾时，”Phillippines” 应为 “Philippines”。 描述泰国城市化增长时，”Thailand’s citilization remained a steady growth” 应为 “Thailand’s urbanization showed steady growth”。 “surpassed by Indonesia in 2000” 应该提供具体数据支持，否则读者可能会对此感到困惑。 最后一段的总结很好，不过 “displayed a increase pattern” 应为 “displayed an increasing pattern”，并且 “speed of growth are various” 应为 “speed of growth varies”。 基于以上的点评，你的作文可能会在6.5到7分之间，具体分数取决于你的整体表达、词汇的多样性、语法的准确性以及是否完全覆盖了题目要求。 这是根据上述建议修改后的作文： The line graph depicts the &#x3D;&#x3D;changing urban population ratios&#x3D;&#x3D; in four Asian countries from 1970 to 2020, with &#x3D;&#x3D;projections up to 2040&#x3D;&#x3D;. Starting at 30%, Malaysia’s &#x3D;&#x3D;urbanization&#x3D;&#x3D; steadily increased to over 72% by 2020 and &#x3D;&#x3D;is expected to reach&#x3D;&#x3D; approximately 82% by 2040. Indonesia exhibited a similar pattern, with an increase from 12% in 1970 to 50% in 2020, projected to rise to around 60% by 2040. In contrast, the Philippines started at just over 31% in 1970, peaked at 50% between 1980 and 1990, and slightly receded to 48% in 2020. Thailand, beginning at 12% in 1970, experienced steady urbanization and was overtaken by Indonesia’s urban population in 2000. Thailand is forecasted to reach an urbanization level of 45% by 2040. In conclusion, all four nations have experienced urban growth, with continued expansion anticipated. However, the rate of urbanization varies from one country to another. 这样的改写更加准确地反映了图表的信息，并修正了一些语法和拼写错误。","tags":["ielts writing"],"categories":["IELTS Learning"]},{"title":"IELTS Speaking","path":"/2024/03/25/IELTS-Speaking/","content":"Part 1 Do you work or are you a student?
